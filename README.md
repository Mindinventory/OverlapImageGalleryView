# Usage

* Dependencies

    Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file:
    
    Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

    ```groovy
	    allprojects {
		    repositories {
			    ...
			    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		    }
	    }
    ```


    Step 2. Add the dependency
    ```groovy
	    dependencies {
		    implementation 'com.github.Mindinventory:OverlapImageGalleryView:1.0.2'
	    }
    ```

```Fragment/Activity
    //------limit number of items to be overlapped     
    private val overlapLimit = 5     
  
    //------set value of item overlapping in percentage between 0 to 100
    private val overlapWidthInPercentage = -50
  
    //------set item decoration for item overlapping
    recyclerView.addItemDecoration(OverlapRecyclerViewDecoration(overlapLimit, overlapWidth))
    recyclerView.adapter = mAdapter         
    mAdapter.setImageList(setDummyArrayList())
    
    
    //------ Implement OverlapRecyclerViewClickListener interface to get callback of items click.
    override fun onNormalItemClicked(adapterPosition: Int) {
        toast(this,"Normal item clicked >> $adapterPosition")
    }

    override fun onNumberedItemClick(adapterPosition: Int) {
        toast(this,"Numbered item clicked >> $adapterPosition")
        // Here you can add remaining items in list or open seperate screen.
    }
